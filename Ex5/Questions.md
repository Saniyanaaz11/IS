#  Experiment 5 – Primality Testing

1. What is the main difference between deterministic and probabilistic primality tests?  
2. How does the Miller–Rabin test determine if a number is probably prime?  
3. Why are large prime numbers critical in modern cryptography?  
4. What is trial division and why is it inefficient for large numbers?  
5. How does primality testing contribute to RSA key generation?
