#  Experiment 3 – Hashing & Symmetric Cryptography

1. What is the main difference between hashing and encryption?  
2. Why is SHA-256 considered a one-way function?  
3. How does AES differ from DES in terms of key size and security?  
4. What is the purpose of initialization vectors (IVs) in block ciphers?  
5. Why can’t hashed data be decrypted back to the original form?
