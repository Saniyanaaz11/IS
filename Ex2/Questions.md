#  Experiment 2 â€“ RSA (Asymmetric Cryptography)

1. What are the two prime numbers used in RSA for?  
2. How is the public key different from the private key?  
3. Why is RSA considered computationally secure?  
4. What mathematical operation makes decryption possible in RSA?  
5. What would happen if p and q were not prime?
