#  Experiment 6 – Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange

1. What is the goal of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange?  
2. Why is it considered secure even when the exchange happens over a public channel?  
3. What is the role of the generator `g` and prime `p` in the algorithm?  
4. How do both parties end up with the same shared secret?  
5. What is a man-in-the-middle attack, and how can DH be protected against it?
