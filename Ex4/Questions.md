#  Experiment 4 – Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

1. What mathematical concept underlies elliptic curve cryptography?  
2. How does ECC achieve the same level of security as RSA with smaller keys?  
3. What is the role of public and private keys in ECC encryption?  
4. What is the purpose of the “curve” in ECC?  
5. How does ECIES differ from RSA encryption?
